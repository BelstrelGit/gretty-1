What is Gretty
=============
Gretty is a simple web framework for both building web servers
and clients. Built on top of netty, it supports NIO style http
server, asynchronous http client. It also supports both websocket
server and client.

It's designed to be light weight and run as a standalone embedded solution.

It's written in [Groovy++](http://code.google.com/p/groovypptest/wiki/Welcome).
But you can use it with pure Groovy, Scala or even Java.
